# Recover Binary Search Tree

[Leetcode Problem 99](https://leetcode.com/problems/recover-binary-search-tree/)

## Problem Statement

Two elements of a binary search tree (BST) are swapped by mistake. Recover the tree without changing its structure.

### Example 1

```text
Input: [1,3,null,null,2]

   1
  /
 3
  \
   2

Output: [3,1,null,null,2]

   3
  /
 1
  \
   2
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: [3,1,4,null,null,2]

  3
 / \
1   4
   /
  2

Output: [2,1,4,null,null,3]

  2
 / \
1   4
   /
  3
```

### Follow up

A solution using O(n) space is pretty straight forward. Could you devise a constant space solution?
